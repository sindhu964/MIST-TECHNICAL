1.   PW Crack 5:

By making the following changes in the level5.py file, we obtain the flag,

def level_5_pw_check():
    # user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    with open("dictionary.txt") as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            user_pw = line.strip()
            user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
            
            if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
                print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
                decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
                print(user_pw)
                print(decryption)
                return
            print("That password is incorrect")


On executing , flag: picoCTF{h45h_sl1ng1ng_fffcda23}

3. Useless:

#!/bin/bash
# Basic mathematical operations via command-line arguments

if [ $# != 3 ]
then
  echo "Read the code first"
else
        if [[ "$1" == "add" ]]
        then
          sum=$(( $2 + $3 ))
          echo "The Sum is: $sum"

        elif [[ "$1" == "sub" ]]
        then
          sub=$(( $2 - $3 ))
          echo "The Substract is: $sub"

        elif [[ "$1" == "div" ]]
        then
          div=$(( $2 / $3 ))
          echo "The quotient is: $div"

        elif [[ "$1" == "mul" ]]
        then

On entering "man useless" in the terminal:

useless
     useless, â€” This is a simple calculator script

SYNOPSIS
     useless, [add sub mul div] number1 number2

DESCRIPTION
     Use the useless, macro to make simple calulations like addition,subtraction, multiplication and division.

Examples
     ./useless add 1 2
       This will add 1 and 2 and return 3

     ./useless mul 2 3
       This will return 6 as a product of 2 and 3

     ./useless div 6 3
       This will return 2 as a quotient of 6 and 3

     ./useless sub 6 5
       This will return 1 as a remainder of substraction of 5 from 6

Authors
     This script was designed and developed by Cylab Africa

     picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_8504}

Therefore flag: picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_8504}
