3.  RSA:

RSA encryption algorithm is a type of public-key encryption algorithm.

Pseudo Code (Example):
int x = 61, int y = 53;
int n = x * y;
// n = 3233.

// compute the totient, phi
int phi = (x-1)*(y-1);
// phi = 3120.

int e = findCoprime(phi);
// find an 'e' which is > 1 and is a co-prime of phi.
// e = 17 satisfies the current values.

// Using the extended euclidean algorithm, find 'd' which satisfies 
// this equation:
d = (1 mod (phi))/e;
// d = 2753 for the example values.

public_key = (e=17, n=3233);
private_key = (d=2753, n=3233);

// Given the plaintext P=123, the ciphertext C is :
C = (123^17) % 3233 = 855;
// To decrypt the cypher text C:
P = (855^2753) % 3233 = 123;



Benefits of RSA Encryption:

Security:  RSA cryptography has a secure algorithm that safeguards data transmission.
Public key cryptography:  RSA uses a public key cryptography algorithm for security. It means it uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
Key exchange:  Since the RSA algorithm uses two keys for encryption and decryption, itâ€™s possible to exchange secret keys without actually sending the private key over the network. It allows the encryption and safe transmission of data without sending decryption keys beforehand.
Digital signatures:  RSA algorithm is perfect for digital signatures because the sender can sign a document or message using a private key while the receiver verifies the signature using a public key.
